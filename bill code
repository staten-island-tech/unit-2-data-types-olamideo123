#Let's create a function to accept a "bill" value and offer a tip of 0%, 15%, 20% or 25% depending on if the service was "bad, okay, good , or great ".

bill = 300  

if bill > 25: 
    print('great')
if bill > 20: 
    print('good')
if bill > 25: 
    print('okay')  
if bill > 25: 
    print('bad')
